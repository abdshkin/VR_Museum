room_base.glb — PLACEHOLDER NOTE
==================================

This file is a placeholder. The museum uses a procedurally-built Three.js room,
so a .glb file is NOT required for the prototype to work.

To use a custom GLB model:
1. Export your room from Blender as room_base.glb (Draco compressed recommended)
2. In js/app.js → buildRoom(), add a GLTFLoader section:

   import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';
   const loader = new GLTFLoader();
   loader.load('assets/models/room_base.glb', gltf => {
     scene.add(gltf.scene);
   });

3. Remove the manual addBox() room geometry below that comment.

Recommended GLB specs:
  - Max file size: 5MB (for mobile performance)
  - Textures: baked into GLB, 1024×1024 max
  - Faces: < 50k tris
